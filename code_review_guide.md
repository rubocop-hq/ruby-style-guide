*Definition:*

Code review is the process in which code written by a developer is inspected by another person to look for defects and improvements. In other words, developers work on their code mostly in isolation and call for a review when they are ready.

*Goals of Code Review:*

Simplify Code
Make sure acceptance criteria are met
Keep code maintanable
Maintain code style
Keep good test coverage

*Roles*

*Management:*

Don't use code reviews as a means to produce developer performance metrics (ie Code Review grades).  They should only be viewed through the lens of work towards the best code possible being delivered.

*Reviewers:*

Remain polite.
Prefer to comment as an observer, "I did not see what was going on here." vs "This doesn't make sense."
Comment about the code not the author.
Praise good decisions alongside critiquing others.
Avoid philosophical debates when possible.  Stick to code issues that are in line with the stated Goals above.
For style problems, word your thoughts as questions about why the style guide was not followed, the writer could have a good reason. ie, "Did you mean to leave out the parantheses?"
The goal is not to prove yourself a superior programmer.
Avoid "Why" questions, using "why" can seem accusatory.
Don't think you need to follow a "script", reviews should be a conversation.

*Developers:*

Making sure to follow our style guide will make it easier to review your code.
Remember, the target of the review is the code not you.  Try not to become defensive, everyone makes mistakes (EVERYONE).
Taking pride in your work is natural.  Defend your work if you think critiques are missing something, but remain flexible.
It is okay to ask questions of the reviewer if you are not clear on what they are saying.
Saying thanks is nice.


IDEAS:
Link code reviews/PRs as examples for style guide
Severity ratings on comments (Blocking, non-blocking, trivial, etc)
With continuos integration:
  keep PRs as small as possible, break stories down if needed
  use feature flags to turn off incomplete features
